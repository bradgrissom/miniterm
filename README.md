# miniterm
Serial Miniterm

This is a simple serial terminal for use with RS232 devices on desktop linux
as well as a simple serial terminal on embedded systems with a UART.

For example on a raspberry pi with gcc installed locally, you can simply type
"make" and compile and use the miniterm on the Pi itself.
